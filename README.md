### The Game

[![txt](https://github.com/ofaura/Andro_Dunos/blob/master/androdun.png?raw=true)](https://youtu.be/FYyT9rK8hGw)

Andro Dunos is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up developed by Japan based Visco Games Corporation, set in the far future
where you play the role of an ace pilot in a sci-fi combat ship designed with 4(check) (way, laser, 
home, rear) weapon settings which the player can switch to at any moment of gameplay. The player, with the help 
of these weapons and of enemy ship dropped power-ups, must shoot their way through mobs of enemies and bosses
to advance through levels and defeat the alien invaders of the Earth (wikipedia reference).
