### The Game

Andro Dunos is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up developed by Japan based Visco Games Corporation, set in the far future
where you play the role of an ace pilot in a sci-fi combat ship designed with 4 (way, laser, 
home, rear) weapon settings which the player can switch to at any moment of gameplay. The player, with the help 
of these weapons and of enemy ship dropped power-ups, must shoot their way through mobs of enemies and bosses
to advance through levels and defeat the alien invaders of the Earth.
